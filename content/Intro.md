Hi, welcome to my site! My name is Mary Ella. I am from a small town in southeastern Kentucky. I am now a junior here at UK. My parents both wen to UK themselves for engineering, so I would 
like to say that influenced my decision to be where I am today. On campus, I am a group fitness instructor; my favorite class that I teach is indoor cycling. This is my first semester as an ICT
major so I am really excited to begin. Something I am looking forward to this semester is some exposure to HTML and learning frontend strategies. My personality is very much a people person; I can talk to just
about anybody. I would be more suited for a role such as this because I enjoy collaboration, teamwork and learning from others. During the summer, my family and I enjoy going to the lake and 
I would like to brag that I am an avid wakesurfer.
