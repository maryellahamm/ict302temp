This blog post is going to simulate what our real assignments on WordPress would be like. The post can be on a topic of our choice related to ICTs. However, this is not an individual blog post because each team member will assume their roles and help contribute to this post. We plan to rotate roles throughout the year because I personally, do not know what each role will be in charge of and what I would enjoy the most so I think this is an easy way to get some exsposure.
# The requirements for these posts include:
* a post containing at least 300 words.
* use of at least 2 Markup elements
* proper inclusion of media
* identification of team member's roles
* discuss and report communication and improvements

**To conclude,**
