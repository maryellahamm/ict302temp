Hi, my name is Mary Ella. I am from a small town in southeastern Kentucky. I am now a junior here at UK. My parents both went to UK themselves for engineering, so I would 
like to say that influenced my decision to be where I am today.
This is my first semester as an ICT
major so I am really excited to begin. Over quarantine, I decided computer science might be too secluded for my liking so I found something that was still involving technology, but where I could be a little more creative with my work.
Something I am looking forward to this semester is exposure to HTML and learning frontend strategies. My personality is very much a people person; I can talk to just
about anybody. I would be more suited for a role such as this because I enjoy collaboration, teamwork and learning from others. On campus, I am a group fitness instructor; my favorite class that I teach is indoor cycling. During the summer, my family and I enjoy going to the lake and 
I would like to brag that I am an avid wakesurfer.
