<h1>Delivery Formats </h1>

One of the definitions our group has decided to expand on is the delivery formats of the content. By Barker’s definition of a content management system, we know that the goal of these systems is to “automate the tasks around the management of content... and ultimately deliver content.” As a team, we feel confident in our ability to define a CMS and the workflow of the steps before publishing, but we still could learn more about how the creator decides which way the content could reach the most viewers.  

A factor that content publishers consider before their posts become live for an audience to search, is called metadata. These are fields use tags and categories to promote your post with similar searches. This allows content to be resulted more frequently in search results and suggested for posts that are of a similar topic.  

For example, if a user is searching for Halloween costumes and your site has a post about creating costumes from items around the house, your post might be suggested because of the similar tag of ‘costumes.’  When posts are created, the writer should consider how big of an audience they hope to reach by writing a description, including the keywords, using a clever title and adjusting accessibility settings.

<h1>Content Modeling</h1>

 

The content model allows creators to represent their media with a way of intention. After some research, I would consider the structuring of the content to be a frontend concept. It deals a lot with the visual impact of the reader and how they will interpret the information. Content modeling considers elements such as text, media, location tags and date lines. 

In an article on Prismic titled “A very brief introduction to content modeling,” the author compares a content model as the “bridge between content and code...a compromise between completely free-style content design and highly structured content representation on the frontend.”  

Before we begin the modeling of our content, we would like to break the text into custom types. Whether this is a blog or an artist’s website, we do not want every page looking exactly the same. For one, this is disengaging and secondly, selecting one type isn’t going to suit the needs of every feature you want to be displayed.  

Breaking down the types of content models we choose come down to two categories. First of all, these custom types mean that you will be able to add varying content fields from categories to binary fields or whatever you need for that type. Within these custom types, we divide them into two categories: repeatable and single types. Just as they sound, a repeatable type would be the layout we want to use for posts. Because you might be posting weekly or daily, we want to find a custom type that is going to offer us the features we are looking for and can be replicated often to make our posts. On the other hand, single types are going to be built around the features of the pages that we might only edit every few posts. For example, our homepage may highlight our most recent posts, but the layout doesn’t change from week to week. Pages that contain information about the author, how the site came about and a terms and conditions page might not be edited for weeks at a time so it would make since to use a single type model.

For example, say we are making a food/health blog. The layout we would like to use as out homepage will be different in the way we want to represent a post with a recipe. On our homepage, we would like to have large media types to grab the viewers' attention; maybe a GIF of a recipe being combined with links to different posts of our site. We want a top menu with quick links to posts, contact information, maybe an introduction page for the blogger.  

Within these types of custom models, we have designs on the pages that are static and dynamic features. As you might guess, our static features will remain at the top of the pages with a similar type and display information such as the title, date and maybe the length of the post. Another design feature is the dynamic zone. This is what we would call the chunk of the post. All the content written on that subject will be in this zone where authors can edit text, images and videos in their weekly posts. 

 

The biggest takeaway from learning content modeling is that as you are building these models, you are affecting the experience of the content author. It is important to consider the direct impact on convenience that the models will have on the author as far as helping them create and edit their pages.
