#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. This week's discussion post informed me about content modeling, which is one of the annotated definitions I chose to write about. In my own research, I learned about types and static/dynamic design. This week's reading taught me more about content attributes and their data types. I learned the content types, for example, would be a page, a post, a FAFSA form or a book database. Each of these types are going to require different attributes. In a book database, the attributes that would be helpful to collect and organize would be author, publication date, book title and maybe genre. Each of these fields will require a different type of answer. The publication date and genre will be of two different datatypes. And rightfully so. Sorting books by genre, we would want to create a custom data type that gave our authors several options for the genre. Using a custom data type for this fieldn can allow users to sort by a genre of interest.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- In this week's discussion post, I compared the types of data attributes an author would use when making a post on either WordPress or Hugo. By directly comaring the twom a few differences I noticed was how Hugo wants users to manually enter a lot of their data attributes on their own. For example, the "draft" field wants a boolean answer of true or false to describe the publication of this post. Where on WordPress, the content is saved as a draft until the author chooses to select "publish" and then the date and time are automatically generated and updated to the post.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. This week is a bit of a slower week compared to last week. Most of our assignments are individual so we communicate with each other if we have any questions on the individual tasks. Per usual, we assigned roles for the blog post report and aim to have the assignment commpleted by Friday.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- A blog that I have found that has added my knowledge in content management is Prismic.io. I found this blog when researching the basics of content modeling. It has been a very helpful source for my annotated definitions draft. As always, Barker's readings are very insightful. This week, I learned about an open vs. closed CMS. I see that in an open source, the CMS can be manipulated for the user but does not offer as much security as an closed CMS would. With security of a closed CMS comes with a little bit of restriction as far as manipulating the code on your site. 

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. My team suggested w3schools.com as a resource to learn more HTML and become more familiar through examples. Since I am uploading the annotated definitions assignment directly to WordPress, I know that I will need to be able to add markdown elements to this assignment. I wanted to complete this step myself so I found the resource markdownguide.com where many examples are shown. I know I could always ask my team for help, but I would like to try self-directed learning first.
