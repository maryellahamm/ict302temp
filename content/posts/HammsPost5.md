#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel distinguished in my ability to identify what it means to be a true CMS now. I researched Hugo and found several resources as to why we consider Hugo to be a CMS, but not the best one out there if you are going to be using it for extensive work. I noticed a lot of users talked highly of WordPress as a CMS so I am excited to begin our classes using that system. This week, I also learned about how much presentation impacts your content. This week, I learned the separation between content and presentation in a CMS and why it is important to let these be separate roles. This is an important concept in the design aspect of a CMS. This decision should be made based on audience, message and content. 
#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- Last week's assignment prepared me to "check off" this learning objective; I compared Hugo and WordPress to see which platform constitutes as a CMS. After my readings, I see that many people agree it is based on the use for the system and the owner's familiarity with coding. It is up to the owner of the CMS to choose how much customization that would like to have; a lot of reviewers discouraged Hugo if you want to have less structure to your site.
#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- After last week's assignment, I feel more comfortable with the discussion and use of workflows. Looking at Kanban techniques, I know the purpose of this system is to create organization and a visual checklist for your team. After creating my own sort of workflow using Microsoft Teams, I feel prepared for our WordPress projects and my ability to layout the plans ahead of time to make sure our project is successful. While I was writing the script for the dummy assignments last week, I noticed the rubrics look for the use of workflows among teams. This should be an easy point to receive because organization is key for group projects and this is a good routine to establish.
#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begun to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of themes to represent your content. In Module 5, we were able to explore CSS Zen Garden which is a super cool website about displaying content in various ways. This site is a collection that designers have made as templates for users to easily implement this look to their own website. I have also been learning about Markdown elements in previous assignments. I have completed some research about the use of Markdown elements to increase the visual appeal of a CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. 
#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn different ways to present our content. I had a hard time uploading my first few themes and updating my site, but eventually I did get the theme to display on my site. I used docs.github.com as a resource to get more assistance on uploading the theme.
