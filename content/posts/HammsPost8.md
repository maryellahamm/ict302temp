#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. This week, our group worked on our annotated definitions assignments where we selected to concepts we feel the most strongly about defining. We chose to define content modeling and delievery formats. For these definitions, I feel comfortable from what I have read from Barker about being able to define and demonstrate these concepts.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- Now that we are working weekly with WordPress and Hugo, I feel comfortable with both of these platforms. There are features availiable on both sites that have an advantage over others. Last week, we read an article about how features on CMS's cannot be classified as binary. That article changed my thinking on how the features can be added and adjusted to the user's needs.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We assign roles for the blog post and then look at upcoming assignments. This week plan to complete the annotated definitions assignment so that we will not have too many things pile up at once. If needed, we will meet virtually one other time during the week just to see how everyone is doing on their tasks. We keep daily communcation in our Microsoft Teams channel.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begin to use to enhan

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. My team suggested w3schools.com as a resource to learn more HTML and become more familiar through examples.
