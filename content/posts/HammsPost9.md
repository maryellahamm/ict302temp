#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. Our group decided to split up our tasks this week so that each member could write confidently about their topic. I chose to write on our annotated definitions assignment. I have always been the most interested in frontend development so I liked the freedom to choose concepts that dealt with the frontend of a CMS. By choosing delievery formats and content modeling, I was able to research these concepts more and define them on the assignment.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- Now that we are working weekly with WordPress and Hugo, I feel comfortable with both of these platforms. There are features availiable on both sites that have an advantage over others. In class as we were discussing which walkthrough topics we wanted to do, my team suggested the walkthroughs about being on the same task on varying systems. So we are going to demonstrate a concept in WordPress as well as Hugo. This is a great way to directly compare our thoughts on the two systems by trying to complete the same task. This way we can draw our likes and differences between the two.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We assign roles for the blog post and then look at upcoming assignments. This week, the workflow my team and I decided to go with was by dividing the assignments based on our comfort level. Because I said I enjoy writing content, I said I would select the definitions assignment and write the post and then might need some team help with adding Markdown elements in WordPress. We check-in with each other throughout the week using Teams just to make sure everyone is on task and if they need help.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have began to use to enhance my skills with creating content is the source w3schools.com. My team showed me this website recently where you can learn HTML through examples. HTML is a key to enhancing your content for inserting media, editing text and adjusting the layout. This is a skill I need to work on to create more engaging content posts. While working on the definitions assignment, I ran across the blog prismic.io which was super helpful for learning about content modeling. I haven't explored the site for more than the topic of content modeling, but I plan to.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. My team suggested w3schools.com as a resource to learn more HTML and become more familiar through examples. Since I am uploading the annotated definitions assignment directly to WordPress, I know that I will need to be able to add markdown elements to this assignment. I wanted to complete this step myself so I found the resource markdownguide.com where many examples are shown. I know I could always ask my team for help, but I would like to try self-directed learning first.
