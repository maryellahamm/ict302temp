As we have began Module 2, I feel more confident than last week in my ability to identify kep concepts in web content management. I feel more confident because of the resources I have read. In "Why You Need Two Typer of Content Strategist," I gathered a better understanding of what a frontend and backend developer are. I figured out my interest is more in the design and looks of a site. Of course the functionality is just as important, but I like being able to get creative with the design of sites. 
I feel more confident than last week in my ability to define what content is. It surprised me what we would consider "not content" after reading some of my peers' discussion posts.
I am not yet familiar with the establishment of workflows. For last weeks module, I did a littl ebit of research to get a general understanding of workflows, but since then I have not looked into this subject much more.
After my second week of using Hugo, I feel more comfortable with employing technologies related to content management. I am getting pretty quick about working Hugo and constructing my blog posts. I find the site very user-friendly even for someone like me who does not have much experience witht the HTML language.
Finally, for self-directed learning, this is a concept I feel comfortable with as well. I have mentioned how this is my first semester as an ICT major and it is crazy to be completing assignments that you do not dread today. Up until this semester, I have had zero interest in what I have been learning about and I was really using every assignment to just "get through." Now that I have enrolled in courses where I have assignments that I am interest in, I do not find it difficult at all to do homework and enjoy learning about our class. This makes it much easier to go beyond the homework and educate yourself even more beyond the scope of the assignment.
