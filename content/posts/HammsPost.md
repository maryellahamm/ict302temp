This week I learned the definition for a content management is technically "a set of tools that provides an organization with a way to manage digital information..without prior knowledge of web programming," according to an article I read on SearchContentManagement.techtarget.com. Would I have been able to define that myself? Probably not, but I had a good guess what a system would entail. In my own words, a web management system is a way to organize a companany's digital information where the hard work has been done by programmers to set up the use of a user-friendly interface for essentially anybody to input their data. 
Like I said, I have little knowledge on web management systems so far, but what I do know is that these systems use varying templates, security settings and plug-ins to make custom systems based on the clients needs. I think that is very interesting actually, that is something I could see myself learning and providing for clients.
Features like a workflow management seem to be like a task of codes or assignments that need to be completed before the next step can be administered. 
I am seeing some technologies and features that relate to content management from the research I am doing. One technology that comes to mind about add-on technologies related to these systems would be an email notification for when your subscribed company has made a new post or added new aarrivals to their site.
I can confidently say that I am able to find resources dor self-directed learning. Prior to just a little bit of research, I could have told you little to none about the subject. Now that I am reading, I realize this isn't that unfamiliar territory; I just didnt have the vocabulary of these web systems.
