#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, my team and I feel distinguished in our ability to identify concepts of content management. Our group has divided up our mid-semester assignments by concepts we each feel the most confident with to define. We chose to define content modeling and delievery formats for our annotated definitions assignment. For these definitions, I feel comfortable from what I have read from Barker about being able to define and demonstrate these concepts. For our walkthroughs, we wanted to provide a tutorial of how to set up a server on WordPress and an external site. Our group feels confident about defining key concepts in a CMS. We decided as a group which concepts we felt were the most important and that we could provide the most detail about. As we went with content modeling and delivery formats, my group read the content that I had written for the two definitions and offered any feedback they could think of. Before publishing, a group member proofread my post for edits then we submitted.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- As we work with WordPress and Hugo, our group feels comfortable with both of these platforms. There are features availiable on both sites that have an advantage over others. Last week, we read an article about how features on CMS's cannot be classified as binary. That article changed my thinking on how the features can be added and adjusted to the user's needs. For our walkthroughs, we are discussing how a server can be set up on two different management systems. I think this is a great example to capture our knowledge on the differences of CMS's as we show a tutorial on two different platforms.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We assign roles for the blog post and then look at upcoming assignments. My team discusses a weekly workflow regarding 

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have began to use to enhance my skills with creating content is the source w3schools.com. My team showed me this website recently where you can learn HTML through examples. HTML is a key to enhancing your content for inserting media, editing text and adjusting the layout. This is a skill I need to work on to create more engaging content posts.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. My team suggested w3schools.com as a resource to learn more HTML and become more familiar through examples.
