#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. This week's assignments taught me the different types of content shaping. This a concept that relates different types of media for different reasons. By identifying each type of content model in our Canvas CMS, I really understood the concept of each model. It was a little bit harder to identify the content shapes in Hugo versus WordPress; this was a bit of a challenge for me, but allowed me to understand the concept more.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- In this week's assignment, we were tasked to find different content types in both Hugo and WordPress. This was a bit of a challenge to me because the shapes that content is formatted in might be the same, but each CMS uses different ways to show these shapes. Canvas was the easiest CMS to identify the shapes of the content. When I was comparing the shapes of WordPress and Hugo, the way each site chooses to display their content is different so it was hard for me to compare them side by side.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. This week is a bit of a slower week compared to last week. 

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- A blog that I have found that has added my knowledge in content management is Prismic.io. I found this blog when researching the basics of content modeling. It has been a very helpful source for my annotated definitions draft. As always, Barker's readings are very insightful. This week, I learned about an open vs. closed CMS. I see that in an open source, the CMS can be manipulated for the user but does not offer as much security as an closed CMS would. With security of a closed CMS comes with a little bit of restriction as far as manipulating the code on your site. 

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. My team suggested w3schools.com as a resource to learn more HTML and become more familiar through examples. I have used HTML pretty frequently so I am feeling confident in my ability to use HTML in my WordPress posts.
