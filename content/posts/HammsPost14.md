#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. Previous week's assignments taught me the different types of content shaping. I would say this was one of the harder concepts for me to grasp. This week, we explored multichannel content distribution which is a big concept for advertising content. Our readings this week openend my eyes to ways I did not think of content being distributed in the ways Barker mentioned. I also learned about RSS which is a plugin creators can use to help listeners recieve their content as it is published in their preferred way.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- In last week's assignment, our team was tasked with exploring a CMS that none of us had heard of before called Omeka. This CMS is geared toward art and historical preservation and display is how I would describe it. Comparing this site to Hugo and Wordpress, I would see no use in having to explore this site again, but it is good to expose yourself to different CMS's so that you can appreciate all of the features that Hugo and WordPress give you. We looked at a fitness blog in class and I am getting familiar enough with WordPress to recognize that this was more than likely created with WordPress. Our task this week is to install a plug-in our class website might find useful. By comparing CMS, we know what type of sites are out there and what extensions we could add to enhance our site. 

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We continue to successfully use our workflow to complete our given tasks each week. We establish roles on Monday and usually chat about progress on Thursday. Since being tasked with our extra team project, we chat a little bit more about which plug-ins we decide to install, for example. This week, we are tasked with adding useful extensions to our class website. Last week, we all did some individual exploration with plug-ins so we will have to meet and discuss who found the most handy plug-in for our blog.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- This week, I was tasked with exploring useful plugins for our WordPress site. I found plugins that enhanced security on WordPress sites. For sites that are requesting sensitive information, we may want to add two-factor authentification capabilities. For our blog site, this wouldn't be of much use since our information does not need to have that much protection. A useful plug-in our blog could use, however, would be a WordPress to Hugo converter. This would be a helpful plugin to install onto our site because we convert our class blog to Hugo and directly compare the two. Our extra project is an extension off of this assignment to install a plug-in that would enhanve the site for our classmates. Adding a layer of security is important, but might not make the most sense for our page since our content is just blog reports.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- A topic I needed to look for outside resources for was on installation of plug-ins to the WordPress site. Last week, I found a plug-in tab on the WordPress site that lists all compatiable and useful extensions. This page also shows how tutorials of to install the plug-in step by step. Once my team decides on a plug-in to install, this will be the site we use to learn how to properly install the extension.
