#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. Previous assignments have taught me the different types of content shaping. I would say this was one of the harder concepts for me to grasp. Last week, we explored multichannel content distribution which is a big concept for advertising content. Our readings openend my eyes to ways I did not think of content being distributed in the ways Barker mentioned. I also learned about RSS which is a plugin creators can use to help listeners recieve their content as it is published in their preferred way. I learned that RSS is something I see quite often on store websites and content distributors. After seeing the symbol, I realize this is a very popular way to distribute content.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- With my frequent use of Hugo and WordPress, I am able to identify concepts that I enjoy using better on what platform than another. One of my favorite features on WordPress is the ease of installing plugins and editing the site in an editing view. WordPress offers a library of extensions that creators can explore to find plugins that are compatiable and beneficial to their site. I also have grown to like WordPress's ease of visual editing. It is very clear to edit in your blog post and see how the overall viewing page is going to be affected. I feel that I have been exposed to several different CMS's with many different features.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We continue to successfully use our workflow to complete our given tasks each week. We establish roles on Monday and usually chat about progress on Thursday. Since being tasked with our extra team project, we chat a little bit more about which plug-ins we decide to install, for example. This week, we should be working on our end of the year projects and reaching out to our team members early in the week if we need help.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Last week, I was tasked with exploring useful plugins for our WordPress site. I found plugins that enhanced security on WordPress sites. For sites that are requesting sensitive information, we may want to add two-factor authentification capabilities. For our blog site, this wouldn't be of much use since our information does not need to have that much protection. Plug-ins can enhance the experience for your site visitors and increase security of their information. This week, we added quick access menus onto our class website. Menus can help organize the content on your site and make the content more accessible.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- A topic I needed to look for outside resources for was on installation of plug-ins to the WordPress site. Last week, I found a plug-in tab on the WordPress site that lists all compatiable and useful extensions. This page also shows how tutorials of to install the plug-in step by step.
