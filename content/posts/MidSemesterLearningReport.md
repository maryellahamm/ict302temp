#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

- At this point in the semester, my team and I feel distinguished in our ability to identify concepts of content management. I began the semester not knowing what CMS stood for and now I am able to identify what qualifies a CMS. For the group assignments, we have referred back to a text from Module 3 where Barker compares features against each other. Our group has divided up our mid-semester assignments by concepts we each feel the most comfortable with to define. We chose to define content modeling and delivery formats for our annotated definitions assignment. For these definitions, I feel comfortable from what I have read from Barker about being able to define and demonstrate these concepts. For our walkthroughs, we wanted to provide a tutorial of how to set up a server on WordPress and an external site. Our group feels confident about defining these key concepts in a CMS. We decided as a group which concepts we felt were the most important and that we could provide the most detail about. As we went with content modeling and delivery formats, my group read the content that I had written for the two definitions and offered any feedback they could think of. Before publishing, a group member proofread my post for edits then we submitted.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- As we work with WordPress and Hugo, our group feels comfortable with both of these platforms. There are features available on both sites that have an advantage over others. Last week, we read an article about how features on CMS's cannot be classified as binary. That article changed my thinking on how the features can be added and adjusted to the user's needs. For our walkthroughs, we are discussing how a server can be set up on two different management systems. I think this is a great example to capture our knowledge on the differences of CMS's as we show a tutorial on two different platforms.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We assign roles for the blog post and then look at upcoming assignments. My team discusses a weekly workflow regarding how we will accomplish our tasks. We type in our teams channel who will be responsible for what and when we would like to have these assignments completed. As always, we are available in the chat to help each other if someone gets stuck.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begun to use to enhance my skills with creating content is the source w3schools.com. My team showed me this website recently where you can learn HTML through examples. HTML is a key to enhancing your content for inserting media, editing text and adjusting the layout. Today, I made a post in WordPress where I wanted to wrap the image around my text. Using this resource, I was able to adjust the size and alignment of my image. When drafting my annotated definitions report, I found several articles that discussed content modeling in depth. I learned a lot from a blog known as Prismic.io.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our resource guide on establishing a server on WordPress and a third party platform. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. There are many community resources for help with Wordpress that my team has shown me. In the past, I have referenced w3schools frequently before posting to WordPress to add my HTML elements.
