#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. Previous week's assignments taught me the different types of content shaping. I would say this was one of the harder concepts for me to grasp. This week, my team's extra assignment was to explore useful plug-ins that would enhance our class website. Our content on the site does not request credit card or too much personal information so it is not a neccessity to require authentification. However, I do think this is good practice for sites that offer products or request personal information. For our blog

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- In this week's assignment, our team was tasked with exploring a CMS that none of us had heard of before called Omeka. This CMS is geared toward art and historical preservation and display is how I would describe it. Comparing this site to Hugo and Wordpress, I would see no use in having to explore this site again, but it is good to expose yourself to different CMS's so that you can appreciate all of the features that Hugo and WordPress give you. We looked at a fitness blog in class and I am getting familiar enough with WordPress to recognize that this was more than likely created with WordPress. 

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. We continue to successfully use our workflow to complete our given tasks each week. We establish roles on Monday and usually chat about progress on Thursday. Since being tasked with our extra team project, we chat a little bit more about deciding a theme, for example. This week, we are tasked with looking at Omeka. Hopefully, I will never have to use this CMS in my career. By the looks of it, it is very dated and it created to hold historical art artifacts and used in museums and libraries.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- This week, I was tasked with exploring useful plugins for our WordPress site. I found plugins that enhanced security on WordPress sites. For sites that are requesting sensitive information, we may want to add two-factor authentification capabilities. For our blog site, this wouldn't be of much use since our information does not need to have that much protection. A useful plug-in our blog could use, however, would be a WordPress to Hugo converter. This would be a helpful plugin to install onto our site because we convert our class blog to Hugo and directly compare the two.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- A topic I needed to look for outside resources for was last week's assignment regarding content shapes. The shape that content takes on platforms can have a big impact on the delivery  of the media. I read a blog on themedium.com about how a Facebook content strategist uses business tools to enhance the user's experience. We know that Facebook effectively uses ads to promote products tailored to the user. This is a good example of how structuring media can be a good business tool as well.
