#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel confident in my ability to define web content management. After Week 1, I was able to correctly define content as media that is posted intended for a human audience and has undergone an editorial process. In Week 3, we discussed roles of a content management team. I understand that there are many hats to be worn in this team, but feel confident in my ability to adapt to each job. This week has taught me that by using techniques such as a Kanban, content management teams are able to plan every detail of their process to ensure long-term success.
#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- Content management systems are built custom to the user's needs. Depending on what the system is used for, the creators of the CMS will determine which features will be needed. For example, if the user is needing a system that supports online purchases, the developers will need to ensure that the site has the appropriate security so that information is not leaked. I learned through some research this week that by using add-ons, your system may be exposed to hacking because not all add-ons are trusted and may request access to unnecasary information.
#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- After this week's assignment, I feel more comfortable with the discussion and use of workflows. After doing some research on the Kanban techniques, I know the purpose of this system is to create organization and a visual checklist for your team. After creating my own sort of workflow using Microsoft Teams, I feel prepared for our WordPress projects and my ability to layout the plans ahead of time to make sure our project is successful. Other workflow techniques that my team implemented was using a to-do list. A team memember added our upcoming group assignments as "buckets" to our to-do list in teams. He invited each team member to the "bucket" so that we are all seeing the timeline of our assignments and begin to plan accordingly.
#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begin to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of Markdown elements. I have completed some research about the use of Markdown elements to increase the visual appeal of a CMS. HTML is an enhancing technology to use for your CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. 
#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn Markdown elements and I have been researching a few more sites just to get more examples. The notations seem to be pretty tedious so I like to see examples on other sites. In the last few days, I have found the site Kinsta where they share a free Glossary for those who are working in WordPress. They have a few beginner glossary archives that explain GitHub, WordPress and CMS in general. I was wondering if you had any more Markdown resources that you are more partial to? I was trying to look for some YouTubers who use basic MarkDown tags and show tutorials.
