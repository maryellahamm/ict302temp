#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel confident in my ability to establish and define web content management. This week, my team's blog went live on WordPress. The steps we followed to create this content were by assigning roles, setting goal dates, allowing appropriate communcation and offering feedback. Our WordPress post is
a perfect example of expressing my knowledge of web content management because we practiced the roles of a writer, editor, administrator and developer. Each role was assigned to a team member so that we can become familiar with the
tasks involved. We plan to switch roles each week so that everyone feels distinguished in managing web content.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- This week's assignment with learning familiarity with WordPress and previous assignments with Hugo, I am able to compare the two systems and mark up similarities. This week we explored different Wordpress sites and how to access the code behind any site using this system. After posting on Wordpress this week, I liked all of the settings that can be added to posts and the ease of doing it. It was very easy to add tags, allow comments and suggest categories. One thing that tripped me up on Wordpress was the site logo. I thought I was only changing the logo for the page our post was on but as I looked at other posts, I realized I mistakenly changed the logo for the entire class. 

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- We defined workflows several weeks ago when we were setting up our Microsoft Teams channel. Learning workflows seemed useful, but it wasn't until our group was working together on this week's assignment that I saw how convinent the workflow is. In teams, we used this as our main form of communication. After establishing roles to complete our post on Wordpress, we decided that writer would begin the assignment, then move onto the editor, then the developer and finally, allow the administrators to add some elements and prepare for final publishing. Establishing this workflow made our first group assignment move very smoothly.


#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begin to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of Markdown elements. I have completed some research about the use of Markdown elements to increase the visual appeal of a CMS. HTML is an enhancing technology to use for your CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. In the group's post this week, we used markdown elements such as italicize text, imported media, use of header fonts and adjusting font size.


#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn Markdown elements and I have been researching a few more sites just to get more examples. The notations seem to be pretty tedious so I like to see examples on other sites. I have enjoyed learning Wordpress so far; there is alot of expression that creators can involve on their posts. Something I would like to learn is changing the page theme of only our page without disrupting the settings of other group's posts.
