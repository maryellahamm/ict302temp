#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel confident in my ability to establish and define web content management. This week, my team's blog went live on WordPress. The steps we followed to create this content were by assigning roles, setting goal dates, allowing appropriate communcation and offering feedback. Our WordPress post is
a perfect example of expressing my knowledge of web content management because we practiced the roles of a writer, editor, administrator and developer. Each role was assigned to a team member so that we can become familiar with the
tasks involved. We plan to switch roles each week so that everyone feels distinguished in managing web content.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- This week's assignment with learning familiarity with WordPress and previous assignments with Hugo, I am able to compare the two systems and mark up similarities. This week we explored different Wordpress sites and how to access the code behind any site using this system. After posting on Wordpress this week, I liked all of the settings that can be added to posts and the ease of doing it. It was very easy to add tags, allow comments and suggest categories. One thing that tripped me up on Wordpress was the site logo. I thought I was only changing the logo for the page our post was on but as I looked at other posts, I realized I mistakenly changed the logo for the entire class. 

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- 


- Technologies I have begin to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of Markdown elements. I have completed some research about the use of Markdown elements to increase the visual appeal of a CMS. HTML is an enhancing technology to use for your CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. 


#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn Markdown elements and I have been researching a few more sites just to get more examples. The notations seem to be pretty tedious so I like to see examples on other sites. In the last few days, I have found the site Kinsta where they share a free Glossary for those who are working in WordPress. They have a few beginner glossary archives that explain GitHub, WordPress and CMS in general. I was wondering if you had any more Markdown resources that you are more partial to? I was trying to look for some YouTubers who use basic MarkDown tags and show tutorials.
