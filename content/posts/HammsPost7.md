#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel confident in my ability to establish and define web content management. This is the second week my team and I have published a blog post onto WordPress. The steps we followed to create this content were by assigning roles during our team call, setting goal dates, allowing appropriate communcation and offering feedback. Our WordPress post is
a perfect example of expressing our knowledge of web content management because we practiced the roles of a writer, editor, administrator and developer. Each role was assigned to a team member so that we can become familiar with the
tasks involved. As I was an administrator last week, this week I got the chance to create the content by writing the post. This is the first step of getting the ball rolling for the week. We discuss that the writer should set a goal day that they can complete their end of the task so that everyone else can begin their process.

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- The new weekly posts on Wordpress and previous assignments with Hugo have allowed me to compare the two systems and mark up the similarities. Last week, we explored different Wordpress sites and how to access the code behind any site using this system. After posting on Wordpress this week, I liked all of the settings that can be added to posts and the ease of doing it. It was very easy to add tags, allow comments and suggest categories. This week's assignment allowed to me adjust the settings and use of Wordpress features in context of the media I would be publishing. I decided I would be making a health and wellness blog so features like comments and tags would be helpful for my interaction with my readers.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- We defined workflows several weeks ago when we were setting up our Microsoft Teams channel. Learning workflows seemed useful, but it wasn't until our group was working together on this week's assignment that I saw how convinent the workflow is. In teams, we used this as our main form of communication. Our system we use to tackle each week's projects starts on Monday or Tuesday with a group meeting. In this meeting, we discuss the assignment for the week and some of the midsemester assignments approaching in a few weeks. We will throw around ideas for content on our site and see who feels the most confident on the topic. After establishing a writer, we will place an achievable deadline on the content creation so that the editors can begin revising. After revision, our developer will write in HTML to place the media throughout the post. Finally, our administrator finalizes the post and published, then begins to write our report based on our team's strengths and weaknesses for the week.


#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begin to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of HTML. HTML is an enhancing technology to use for your CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. I could further explore HTML because I do not feel extremely confident in my ability to use HTML. This is a skill that I would like to spend more time researching so that I can feel more comfortable.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn Markdown elements and I have been researching a few more sites just to get more examples. The notations seem to be pretty tedious so I like to see examples on other sites. I have enjoyed learning Wordpress so far; there is alot of expression that creators can involve on their posts. Something I would like to learn is changing the page theme of only our page without disrupting the settings of other group's posts. A friend of mine started a blog using Wordpress and I reached out to her to tell her I was learning a lot about WordPress in one of my classes and that I would reach out to her when I learned helpful tips that I thought she could use.
