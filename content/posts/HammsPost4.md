#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- I feel distinguished in my ability to identify what it means to be a true CMS site now. I researched Hugo and found several resources as to why we consider Hugo to be a CMS but not the best one out there if you are going to be using it for extensive work. I noticed a lot of users talked highly of WordPress as a CMS so I am excited to begin our classes using that system. 
#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- This week's assignment has prepared me to "check off" this learning objective. I compared Hugo and WordPress to see which platform constitutes as a CMS. After my readings, I see that many people agree it is based on the use for the system and the owner's familiarity with coding. It is up to the owner of the CMS to choose how much customization that would like to have; a lot of reviewers discouraged Hugo if you want to have less structure to your site.
#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- After this week's assignment, I feel more comfortable with the discussion and use of workflows. After doing some research on the Kanban techniques, I know the purpose of this system is to create organization and a visual checklist for your team. After creating my own sort of workflow using Microsoft Teams, I feel prepared for our WordPress projects and my ability to layout the plans ahead of time to make sure our project is successful. Other workflow techniques that my team implemented was using a to-do list. A team memember added our upcoming group assignments as "buckets" to our to-do list in teams. He invited each team member to the "bucket" so that we are all seeing the timeline of our assignments and begin to plan accordingly.
#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- Technologies I have begin to use to enhance my CMS this week would be the use of Markdown elements. I have completed some research about the use of Markdown elements to increase the visual appeal of a CMS. HTML is an enhancing technology to use for your CMS. This is my favorite part about learning content management systems is what developers and editors can add on to put their own personalization on the site. Thinking about appealing to the consumer, you have to use these add-on technologies to promote yourself as a marketer. 
#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- I have really enjoyed getting to learn Markdown elements and I have been researching a few more sites just to get more examples. The notations seem to be pretty tedious so I like to see examples on other sites. In the last few days, I have found the site Kinsta where they share a free Glossary for those who are working in WordPress. They have a few beginner glossary archives that explain GitHub, WordPress and CMS in general. I was wondering if you had any more Markdown resources that you are more partial to? I was trying to look for some YouTubers who use basic MarkDown tags and show tutorials.
