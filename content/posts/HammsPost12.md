#### I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.
- At this point in the semester, I feel distinguished in my ability to identify concepts of content management. Last week's assignments taught me the different types of content shaping. I would say this was one of the harder concepts for me to grasp. This week, my team's extra assignment was to explore Omeka. Omeka is an open-source content management system that exhibits cultural heritage objects. It's functionality can be extended with the installation of plugins which is a topic I learned more about this week. I learned the accessibility that plugins bring, aw well as the hassle they sometimes create for a CMS. 

#### I can describe and compare content management systems.
- In this week's assignment, we were tasked to find different content types in both Hugo and WordPress. This was a bit of a challenge to me because the shapes that content is formatted in might be the same, but each CMS uses different ways to show these shapes. Canvas was the easiest CMS to identify the shapes of the content. When I was comparing the shapes of WordPress and Hugo, the way each site chooses to display their content is different so it was hard for me to compare them side by side.

#### I can manage content using established workflows.
- Each week, my team discusses in class, virtually or in-person, how we are going to complete our assignments that week. This week is a bit of a slower week compared to last week. I had a good idea for the blog post this week so I volunteered to write the post this week. We are getting to where our tasks are strting to repeat roles. My team has worked very well with communication as of late.

#### I can identify and employ technologies related to content management.
- A blog that I have found that has added my knowledge in content management is Prismic.io. I found this blog when researching the basics of content modeling. It has been a very helpful source for my annotated definitions draft. As always, Barker's readings are very insightful. This week, I explored Canvas, Hugo and WordPress to look at how content is displayed and organized both for developers and viewers. I had to use outside resources to get more explanation on some of the shapes because I wanted more detail on why this shape was structured this way.

#### I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.
- My team really wanted to focus our walkthrough tutorial on HTML elements. This is something I am not as familiar with and that I will need to spend more time learning before I write a page focusing on these elements. I also needed to use some outside sources when considering shapes that media that takes. I read a blog on themedium.com about how a Facebook content strategist uses business tools to enhance the user's experience. We know that Facebook effectively uses ads to promote products tailored to the user. This is a good example of how structuring media can be a good business tool as well.
